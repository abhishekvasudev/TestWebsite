# Getting Started with Jekyll

Jekyll is a powerful static site generator that's perfect for blogs, portfolios, and documentation sites. In this post, I'll guide you through the process of setting up your first Jekyll site.

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll offers several advantages for web developers:

- **Simplicity**: Write content in Markdown and let Jekyll handle the rest
- **Performance**: Static sites are fast and secure
- **Version Control**: Content and code live together in Git
- **Free Hosting**: GitHub Pages integration makes deployment easy

## Installation

To get started with Jekyll, you'll need Ruby installed on your system. Here's how to install Jekyll:

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

## Creating Your First Site

Create a new Jekyll site with:

```bash
jekyll new my-awesome-site
cd my-awesome-site
```

## Basic Structure

A typical Jekyll site includes:

- `_posts/`: Your blog posts
- `_layouts/`: HTML templates
- `_includes/`: Reusable components
- `assets/`: Images, CSS, and JavaScript
- `_config.yml`: Site configuration

## Writing Posts

Create a new post in `_posts/` with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`:

```markdown
---
layout: post

---

Your content here...
```

## Customization

Jekyll is highly customizable. You can:

- Create custom layouts
- Add plugins

## Deployment

Deploy your site to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository
2. Push your code
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings

## Conclusion
